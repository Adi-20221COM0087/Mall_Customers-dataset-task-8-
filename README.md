# Mall_Customers-dataset-task-8-
The task involved performing unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset. The objective was to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior by analyzing features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The dataset was first preprocessed and standardized, followed by the application of the K-Means algorithm. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, and the clusters were visualized in a 2D space using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The clustering performance was further evaluated using the Silhouette Score, providing insight into how well-defined the clusters were. This task demonstrates the process of customer segmentation and cluster evaluation using essential machine learning tools.
